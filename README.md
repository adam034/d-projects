## Description project

This project is about generating data from gsheet to document format. This project was inspired by a government employee's complaint that she had to work on a large number of SPJ reports. As a result, with this application the SPJ processing time is getting faster, more precise and accurate.

## Step To Reproduce

- Visite this bot on telegram [dibikin-gampang](t.me/devDibikingGampangBot 'dibikin-gampang')
- After that, register first before using the bot by typing /daftar
- Edit the data that will be generated in the following gsheet https://bit.ly/dev-dibiking-gampang
- Don't forget to mark the data to be generated by filling in the kode_berkas column with the spj value
- After that, press the /generate command on the telegram bot and enter the name of the active sheet and the bot will generate the data in the gsheet into a document.
